# Machine-Learning-with-Spark-Streaming
This simulates a real world scenario where you will be required to handle an enormous amount of data for predictive modelling. The data source is a stream and your application faces the constraint of only being able to handle batches of a stream at any given point in time
With this project, you will learn more about how applications in the real world modify their algorithms to work on large data streams and how incremental processing can be leveraged to process and analyze streams over time.
